# AI Search Algorithms Toolbox

This repository contains a collection of classical AI search and optimization algorithms implemented in Python. It's intended as an educational toolkit for students and developers looking to understand how different pathfinding and search methods work in practice.

## 📦 Included Algorithms

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **UCS (Uniform Cost Search)**
- **A\* Search (A-Star)**
- **Depth-Limited Search**
- **Bidirectional Search**
- **Genetic Algorithm** – with a simple GUI

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built to support learning and experimentation with common AI techniques, especially for:

- Academic assignments  
- Teaching demonstrations  
- Personal practice with core AI topics  

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- Tkinter (for the Genetic Algorithm GUI)
